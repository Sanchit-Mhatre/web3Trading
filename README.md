# Web3Trading

This project analyzes historical trading data from multiple cryptocurrency accounts, correlating trade performance (PnL, volume, etc.) with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. The goal is to identify patterns in trader behavior, such as buy/sell strategies under different market sentiments (e.g., Fear, Greed), classify traders based on profitability, and provide overall performance summaries.
